Mining = Solving a complex mathematical puzzle + Validating transactions + Earning rewards



üîç How it works:
Transactions are collected into a pool (called the mempool).

Miners bundle some of these transactions into a block.

The miner must solve a cryptographic puzzle (called Proof of Work in Bitcoin) to make the block valid.

Once solved, the block is broadcast to the network and added to the blockchain.

The successful miner gets a block reward (new coins + transaction fees).
