🪙 There are two main types of mining rewards:
1. Block Reward
This is a fixed amount of new cryptocurrency coins created and given to the miner who successfully mines a new block.

It’s how new coins enter circulation in networks like Bitcoin.

Example:
In Bitcoin (as of 2024), a miner earns 3.125 BTC for each block mined.

2. Transaction Fees
Every transaction includes a fee.

The miner who adds the transaction to a block keeps those fees.

The more transactions included, the higher the total fee reward.

🔁 Over time:
Block rewards decrease (in Bitcoin, they halve every 210,000 blocks).

Eventually, transaction fees will be the only reward, which is designed to make the system sustainable long-term.

💡 Example Breakdown:
Suppose a miner adds a block that includes 2 BTC in transaction fees.

Block reward = 3.125 BTC

Transaction fees = 2 BTC

Total reward = 5.125 BT
